# Home Sales Analysis using SparkSQL

In this challenge we use SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Spark is also used to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

### Key Metrics Analysed

* What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? 

* What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? 

* What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square?

* What is the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000? 

*** Run the Python Notebook for answers.
